# Eln 2 development

Some tidbits about development.

## Licensing

Eln2 is licensed under the MIT license.

Models and artwork need to be under some creative commons license that allows modification and distribution *with* commercial use, [such as this license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

## Languages

Eln2 Core, Apps, and Minecraft Integration is going to be written in Kotlin. Network sockets and shared memory will use Google Protobuffs, and Vintage Story will use C#. The log server uses Rust.

## Project Structure

There are two repositories:

  * [eln2](https://github.com/eln2/eln2): This is all of the Eln2 code.
  * [eln2-web](https://github.com/eln2/eln2-web): This is the website you are reading.

Inside the `eln2` repository, you will find multiple folders:

  * `core` - All of the core MNA, thermal, and shaft based simulation code. No Minecraft or VS code ends up here.
  * `apps` - Standalone Applications and daemons.
  * `integration-mc<version>` - Basically, a Minecraft mod
  * `logcollector` - our Rust log collector.

## Log collection server

For Eln2 pre-alpha development, we will have a crash log handler. What will happen is if the game crashes, we will automatically take the log, and send it out to the development team to a server that can receive these logs and then we can process them.

This will aid in development, and will likely be removed at the alpha stage unless we find it useful. At the pre-alpha stage, we will also send the UUID of players so that we know who had the bug.

## Phases

Just a FYI, these will all be copied sooner or later to GitHub ~~issues~~ Kanban boards, so that it's easier to track progress. There will be a proper set of milestones for this on each of the relevant repositories.

## Phase 1: Modding Integration [DONE]

Core:

- [x] MNA finished

## Phase 2: SingleNode [IN PROGRESS]

I say models and textures, but these are basic as almost all of these items will be removed/edited later.

- [ ] Sim API

- [ ] SingleCable: a current based uninsulated cable that connects similarly to RF pipes
    - [ ] Electrical Sim
    - [ ] Thermal Sim

NOTE: Models are not a priority at this stage as most of the Single* items will be removed later.

Log Server:

- [ ] Centralized log collection server
- [ ] config file disclaimer option (disables the mod unless the user agrees to not pester the devs before alpha)
- [ ] crash logger

## Phase 3: MultiNode

- [ ] Remove Single* or at least de-list it (shadow registry)
- [ ] API v1.0
- [ ] Some reasonable textures

## Phase 5: Alpha Release and debugging
