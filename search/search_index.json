Licensing Eln2 is licensed under the MIT license. Models and artwork need to be under some creative commons license that allows modification and distribution with commercial use, such as this license . Languages Eln2 Core, Apps, and Minecraft Integration is going to be written in Kotlin. Network sockets and shared memory will use Google Protobuffs, and Vintage Story will use C#. The log server uses Rust. Project Structure There are two repositories: * eln2 : This is all of the Eln2 code. * eln2-web : This is the website you are reading. Inside the eln2 repository, you will find multiple folders: * core - All of the core MNA, thermal, and shaft based simulation code. No Minecraft or VS code ends up here. * apps - Standalone Applications and daemons. * integration-mc<version> - Integration code that is between core and Minecraft Forge/Bookshelf. * integration-vs - Integration code that is between core and the Vintage Story Modding API. * logcollector - our Rust log collector. Log collection server For Eln2 pre-alpha development, we will have a crash log handler. What will happen is if the game crashes, we will automatically take the log, and send it out to the development team to a server that can receive these logs and then we can process them. This will aid in development, and will likely be removed at the alpha stage unless we find it useful. At the pre-alpha stage, we will also send the UUID of players so that we know who had the bug. Phases Just a FYI, these will all be copied sooner or later to GitHub issues, so that it's easier to track progress.

Week 18 (April 26 - May 2) A slight hiatus while Caeleron has exams, jrddunbr has interviews. * Baughn updated the codebase to 1.15.2 and included Bookshelf as our UMC replacement. Week 17 (April 19 - April 25) Caeleron worked on uarchComputer Baughn migrated us away from UMC. Baughn wanted something different after working with it briefly. Grissess did some work with the Falstad importer and fixed some other minor MNA bugs. Week 16 (April 12 - April 18) jrddunbr worked on various parsers and the AsmComputer jrddunbr and Caeleron worked on Vintage Story builds using VS Codium, as well as developing the Blueprint Core application Caeleron worked on code cleanup as well as working on a GNU Plot importing system. Baughn continued to work on CI progress and started working on Integration for Minecraft The community voted for Minecraft 1.14 development over Minecraft 1.12 development, after Baughn and jrddunbr noticed that it would be difficult to use Gradle 4.10.3 for any further progress on the project, and thinking that Miinecraft 1.12 did not support Gradle 5 and Forge Gradle 3. We are currently nearing the end of Phase 1. Woo! Baughn pulled in UMC as a Git Subtree. Week 15 (April 5 - April 11) Baughn helped us configure CI using GitHub actions and Caeleron worked on making our standardized tests meet those CI testing requirements. Baughn suggests we set up better tests which Grissess and jrddunbr will do. Baughn and jrddunbr set up the Discord chat on Eln to have new chat rooms for developers. jrddunbr updates the website as there is growing interest in doing Eln2 work. Website was not updated because website development tool was not cooperating. Baughn updated our Gradle configs and also helped us move to Gradle 5 Week 13 - 14 (March 22 - April 4) We discovered Vintage Story is a thing and they have a much better modding API. Caeleron joins the dev team and focuses mostly on making Vintage Story moding work. cam72cam pushes a new UMC release that has a brand new Gradle deployment system that removes the need for special powershell/shell scripts to set up their environment. We have yet to integrate that into our codebase. Week 12 (Mar 15 - Mar 21) Baughn said he has free time coming up, and so we brought him up to speed some on how Eln2 development is going and how to contribute. He suggested we convert to a monorepo, and so we have prepared such a repository . We are still waiting to hear from Grissess and get a concensus on that decision before going with it. Grissess , Baughn , and jrddunbr determined that the repository will be MIT licensed, and we will aim for CC0 or share-alike (commercial friendly). This will be fine, because UMC is LGPLv2.1, which allows us to have a different license so long as we keep our UMC on GitHub basically. There are two scripts in the Integration part of the mod code that are from IR-Integration, and so we may need those few files cleared as MIT to call the whole repo MIT, but we can also just use a license header in those applicable files. Weeks 4-11 (Jan 18 - Mar 14) We were both really busy, and did not have time to develop code. :/ Week 3 (Jan 12 - Jan 18) Grissess works a lot on the MNA solver after jrddunbr tries to do some work but encounters some difficulty with configuring the datatypes efficiently. He also uses a similar methodology to the Falstad solver by having \"stamps\" that modify the matrix from the components. It's worth noting that the old MNA also had the concept of a stamp, and also had some matricies, but the names were a bit.. odd, and difficult to follow. jrddunbr writes a Falstad importer, which can ingest (basic) Falstad circuits and load them into the MNA for processing. Week 2 (Jan 5 - Jan 11) jrddunbr set up a Travis CI page to have a build test on our commits and PR's. Plans are to hopefully have a CD pipeline at some point. cam72cam got back to us about UMC, and we began working to determine how to make UMC generic enough that two completely different mods can use it. Quoting directly from cam72cam on the progress of UMC for newer versions: 1.14.4 still needs support for injecting or generating recipes. I need to work on that at some point or have you two [ jrddunbr and Grissess ] help I have no idea how any of the rendering will be able to be ported to 1.15.x jrddunbr set up the eln2.org website on GitHub Pages, after working with the DNS provider to determine why DNS was not propagating properly to some major resolvers. jrddunbr works on Kotlinizing the sim code Grissess works on figuring out the Gradle import code, turns out it's going to be more difficult than we thought. jrddunbr and Grissess work on determining how to use alternate MNA matrix math providers and make efficient wrappers around different math libraries for benchmarking. Week 1 (Jan 1 - Jan 4) Beginning of the revived Eln2 efforts. Developers are jrddunbr and Grissess On Jan 1, 2020, eln2.org was purchased. This allowed development using the org.eln2.* Java namespace to proceed without suddenly having the domain bought from under our feet. jrddunbr builds a new clean repo for eln2 dev, with just the old mods.eln.sim directory copied on top of a 1.12.2 Forge environment (refactored to org.eln2.sim ) and all Minecraft related methods (eg, NBT) deleted. Eln2 developers guide was created by jrddunbr cam72cam was contacted about Universal Mod Core UMC was selected because: It supports MC 1.12 It is actively developed and maintained It claims that it will support MC 1.14 and MC 1.15 in the near future, and has some decent work to show for it. Grissess and jrddunbr know the developer personally. Grissess worked for three days on figuring out why we were having Gradle issues with importing UMC, but was unable to determine a reliable solution.
